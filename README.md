This is my raw PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript university project named Soundtify :)

There is few steps to run this website locally:
- Install XAMPP, start the Apache and MySQL module.
- In MySQL, create a new database name 'spotify'(my database name), then import into it using the spotify.sql file.
- Copy my 'bigpj' folder, then paste it into your 'htdocs' folder in 'xampp'.
- Go to XAMPP Control Panel, run the 'Admin' action in Apache.
- An window explore opened, left click to the 'bigpj' folder, the website will run right after.

There is an account you can use (in case if you don't want to create one):
