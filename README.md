This is my raw PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript university project named Soundtify :)

There is few steps to run this website locally:
- Install XAMPP, start the Apache and MySQL module.
- In MySQL, create a new database name 'spotify'(my database name), then import into it using the spotify.sql file.
- Copy the 'bigpj' folder, then paste it into your 'htdocs' folder in 'xampp'.
- Go to XAMPP Control Panel, run the 'Admin' action in Apache.
- An window explore opened, left click to the 'bigpj' folder, the website will run right after.
